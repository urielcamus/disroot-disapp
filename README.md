# Disroot app
**Disroot** provides a number of online services, most of which are linked to the user account and can be used through a native mobile client (e.g., you can access and use email from several email apps). But there are also some services that do not require login or do not yet have a specifically designed application.

**DisApp** works as a kind of digital Swiss army knife: all services are accessible from it, offering to install additional software (in case there is none already installed or configured) and providing a better experience for those which do not have a specific app through the **Android WebView** (the component that allows accessing web content within an application).

It also can be used to access all the **Disroot** services that do not require an account:
* Etherpad
* Ethercalc
* Calls
* Private bin
* Upload
* Polls
* Searx

#### Supported languages:
* English
* Spanish
* French
* Italian
* Portuguese
* Dutch
* Serbian

The app may requires to install additional apps. We highly recommend to install them from [**F-Droid**](https://f-droid.org/), a free and open source app store. It can be downloaded from [here](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk).
