<b>Disroot</b> is a platform providing online services based on principles of freedom, privacy, federation and decentralization.
This app is like your Swiss Army knife to the Disroot platform, made by the community for the community.
If you don't have a Disroot account you can still use this  app to access all the Disroot services that do not require an account:
* Etherpad
* Ethercalc
* Private bin
* Upload
* Poll
* Searx
* Diaspora* (requires a Diaspora only account)

The app may require you to install additional apps. We highly recommend you install F-Droid - a free and open source app marketplace - as not all apps can be found on Google's Play Store and F-Droid is more privacy oriented (no tracking, no account needed) you can download it [here](https://f-droid.org/FDroid.apk).
